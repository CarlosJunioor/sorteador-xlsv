## üî® Project functionalities

The Project works with SheetJS and Javascript, together with the .map function, it runs the .xlsv file array and inserts it into that same array.
## ‚úîÔ∏è Technology used

- `HTML`: HTML plays a fundamental role for the application to work correctly with the insertion of `<audio>` elements that will provide JavaScript with the playback controls of the loaded media. The HTML will come ready-made in the initial course files;
- `CSS`: The CSS has a fundamental role to indicate the user's interaction with the graphical interface, therefore it indicates when the buttons are pressed by mouse or keyboard. The CSS will already be ready in the initial course files;
- `JavaScript`: JavaScript will allow us to program the dynamics of controlling the reproduction of a sound, which in principle is being performed by the `<audio>` element, and pass this control to the `<button>` elements, with great care to make an intelligent code, without repetition, that also takes care of the visual aspects with dynamic CSS. Below are some topics covered in the course:

- React
